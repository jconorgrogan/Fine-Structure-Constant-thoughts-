numerology? Probably 

The framework predicts a specific value:

α−1
 =137.03599917703±O(10−12)

where the uncertainty comes from the truncation of the Euler–Maclaurin series at B4. Any future measurement of α inconsistent with this value would falsify the framework. The prediction is also rigid: there are no parameters to adjust.
